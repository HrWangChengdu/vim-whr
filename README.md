# vim-whr

This is my mac-based vim configuration file.

It uses vim plugins, through [Vundle.vim](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) plugin manager:
* [NERDTree] (https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree)
* [vim-nerdtree-tabs] (https://github.com/jistr/vim-nerdtree-tabs)
* [IndentLine] (https://github.com/jistr/vim-nerdtree-tabs)
