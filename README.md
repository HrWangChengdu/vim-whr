# vim-whr

This is my mac-based vim configuration file.

It uses vim plugins, through [Vundle.vim](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) plugin manager:
* [NERDTree] (https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree)
* [vim-nerdtree-tabs] (https://github.com/jistr/vim-nerdtree-tabs)
* [IndentLine] (https://github.com/jistr/vim-nerdtree-tabs)

It deals with strange behavior of key F1-F10 keys on OSX, with reference links:
* [VIM strange behavior] (http://superuser.com/questions/258986/vim-strange-behaviour-f1-10)
* [VIM 7.3 Problem with F1-F10 in terminal ubuntu 10.10] (http://vim.1045645.n5.nabble.com/VIM-7-3-Problem-with-F1-F10-in-terminal-ubuntu-10-10-td3797125.html)

You may also find some of my favorite color schemes under colors folder.
